# CHATBOT

## Intro

### Solution IT
- we offer online shop solutions
- the bot should create tickets to minimize call center staff, categorize tickets to "replace" first level support

### Technologies

- tried to compare Google Cloud Dialogflow and IBM Watson,
  made research to find out what would be better for us 
  (e.g. [this](https://www.g2.com/compare/google-cloud-dialogflow-vs-ibm-watson-assistant) or [this](https://stackshare.io/stackups/dialogflow-vs-ibm-watson))
 -> decided to use Dialogflow as it seems to be easier to set up and administer, easy to implement images, lists etc.
- existing Github project that allows Dialogflow integration, created fork (Vue.js-project, Katrin is experienced)
- created Dialogflow agent

### Show bot and project

- show diagram
- show agent in Dialogflow

- `problem`, `image problem`, `wrong images`, `customer ID`, `one more`, `another problem`, `explanation`, `customer ID`, `that was it` --> END
- `hello`, `i want to call someone` --> END


### Outlook

- bug with `list`- Responses: default desponse shown twice (before and after list)
- make bot create a support ticket
- refactoring
- give the bot more personality (Bob, implement more small talk and images)
